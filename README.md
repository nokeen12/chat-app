# Dre's Simple Chat

## A web chat application that allows for users to add each other as friends, message, and create group chats.

This project was made initially for gaining experience in implementing an online chat feature into a full application. Since then, it has evolved into it's own full stack web application.

## Current Goals

* Create a REST API that allows for full CRUD operations on users, messages and group chats
* Add sending multiple filetypes in chats
* Implement chat customization- changing message bubble colors, font size, and background theme through settings.
* Create working search bar that filters through created usernames
* Display sent messages to users with minimal delay
